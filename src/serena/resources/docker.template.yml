# Serena Docker Configuration
# ============================
# List project directories on the host to mount into the Docker container.
# Each path is mounted as /projects/<basename> (read-write) inside the container.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Edit this file: add your project paths under 'projects:'
#   2. Generate compose: serena docker generate-compose
#   3. Start container:  docker compose up -d
#   4. Open admin panel:  http://localhost:9000

projects:
  # Uncomment and edit the paths below:
  # - C:\Projects\my-erp-project
  # - /home/user/my-python-project
  # - /home/user/my_project

docker:
  # Docker image (uncomment to use a pre-built image instead of building locally)
  # image: serena:latest
  build_context: .                  # Path to Dockerfile directory
  build_target: production          # Docker build target stage

  port_headroom: 5                  # Extra ports beyond project count for runtime adds
